# 2D-Graphics

Multiple 2D graphic algorithms in python. All of them use tkinter library for the user interface.

Transformations.py consists on a painting program, able to draw lines based on some classical line algorithms. Sets of lines make up figures which can be transformed using translation, scaling, rotation shearing and reflection.

Fractals.py consists on some examples of fractal figures. These are divided in: Recusrive Fractals, Julia and Mandelbrot sets, and Iterated Function Systems.

L-Systems.py consists on some examples of L-Systems.
